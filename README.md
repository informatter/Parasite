# Parasite

The contemporary city can be understood as a collection of different organic emergent systems.
Examples of emergence can be the movements of crowds, traffic jams, a group of migrating birds
or markets. The assemblage of a multitude of individual actions and decisions generates outcomes
which cannot be described of the point of view of individual elements but as a collections of systems.
These islands of high density interactions can be mapped using emergent data from location based
networks like Forsquare. By visualizing this data produced by the digital medium, we can see how
social activity in an urban space is distributed and new emergence of spatial relations are formed.
It creates a digital global urban pattern who’s DNA varies depending on each cities activity and
information density clusters.

Parasite is a plugin for Grasshopper written in C#. Parasite retrieves social
data from Forsquare, it’s a tool that aims to swim into the digital behavior of cities around the globe.

The maximum number of queries that can be done is 5,000 results per hour

**Disclaimer**: The code was written a few years ago, and I am not sure if it will compile properly. Probably the Forsquare API has changed, I can update this repo id necessary.
